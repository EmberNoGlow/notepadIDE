# notepadIDE
Dive into the atmosphere of the 90s with notepadIDE - an IDE that is an explorer and notepad combined into one!

## What?!
I wanted to challenge myself to write a program in plain old Notepad. But as always, nothing came of it. **¯\_(ツ)_/¯**

So I made chatGPT write this!

## Usage
### Setup
Download, create a `venv`, install
```
pip install pywin32
```
run `main.py`
### Interface
Well, it's not really there... No, it's not really a console app. It just creates two windows - File Explorer and Notepad (with a fixed size and position).
> It may not fit on your screen, or it may be too small, or it may not launch at all.

## License
Use it as you wish, CC0 license

## Conclusion
**Use a proper IDE, and don't try to glue together Notepad and Explorer in front of the console!**
